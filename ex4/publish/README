This submission contains the implementation of a secure bidirectional payment channel.

Files included:
1. Channel.sol: Solidity smart contract implementing the payment channel logic, including:
   - Channel establishment
   - One-sided closing with signature verification
   - Appeal mechanism for disputing old states
   - Fund withdrawal after appeal period

2. lightning_node.py: Python client for the Lightning Node, implementing:
   - Off-chain state channel management
   - Secure signing and verification of state updates (ChannelStateMessage)
   - Interaction with the Ethereum blockchain for opening, closing, and appealing channels.

The implementation adheres to the provided API and passes the test scenarios for opening, transferring funds, closing (honest and cheating attempts), and withdrawing.
